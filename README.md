`C0004` has been delayed so long by my lazyness. I wanna say sorry to all guys.

It's unbelievable that the library `redisco` do not support expirement.

It is totally mess inside of the code, especailly about exceptions. I think it shows a good example that how to write something unreadable, uncorrectable and show kindness of our CPUs that make it running anyway. That's why it is a *code*, not *project*.

By the way, I love JetBrain.

**TODO LIST**

- Run it on RaspBerry Pi, and make it runnable.
